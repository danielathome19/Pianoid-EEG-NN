Dataset: Joint EEG-fMRI recording during affective music listening.

This dataset was recorded from 21 healthy adult participants viia a joint EEG-fMRI modality while they
listened to a set of music stimuli chosen and generated to produce different affective (emotional)
reponses. Participants self-reported their felt affective states as they listened to the music.
